Device tree for Wileyfox Storm

Until LineageOS gets official cm-14.1 into its repo, this needs a specific
build method.

Grab a vanilla clone of LineageOS cm-14.1 branch

repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b cm-14.1

Now copy the contents of _REPO_SETTINGS_ to <build_root>/.repo/local_manifests/
of your vanilla LineageOS cm-14.1 tree then do 

repo sync --force-sync

***IMPORTANT***
Do not run brunch. This will overload jack and it'll either fail with an
out of memory error or moan that it can't connect. Also, do not use ninja.

How to build:

export USE_NINJA=false
rm -rf ~/.jack*
export ANDROID_JACK_VM_ARGS="-Xmx4g -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -XX:+TieredCompilation"
./prebuilts/sdk/tools/jack-admin kill-server
./prebuilts/sdk/tools/jack-admin start-server
<do a make clobber here if you have had *any* build failure on this tree>
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch cm_kipper-userdebug
make -j4 bacon

Obviously, adjust the make jobs switch to suit your processor's thread capability.

Good luck. If it breaks you get to keep both bits.
