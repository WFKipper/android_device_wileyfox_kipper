Device tree for Wileyfox Storm

Until CyanogenMod gets official cm-14.1 into its repo, this needs a specific
build method.

First, copy the contents of _REPO_SETTINGS_ to <build_root>/.repo/local_manifests/

***IMPORTANT***
Do not run brunch. This will overload jack and it'll either fail with an
out of memory error or moan that it can't connect. Also, do not use ninja.

How to build:

export USE_NINJA=false
rm -rf ~/.jack*
export ANDROID_JACK_VM_ARGS="-Xmx4g -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -XX:+TieredCompilation"
./prebuilts/sdk/tools/jack-admin kill-server
./prebuilts/sdk/tools/jack-admin start-server
<do a make clobber here if you have had *any* build failure on this tree>
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch cm_kipper-userdebug
make -j4 bacon

Obviously, adjust the make jobs switch to suit your processor's thread capability.

Good luck. If it breaks you get to keep both bits.
